\textbf{Abstract---}
We argue that to fully realize the promise of SDNs we need robust methods to update the data plane state in a way that maintains desired consistency properties such as packets should not be dropped. We highlight the inherent trade-off between the strength of the consistency property and the dependencies it imposes among rules at different switches.
For one basic consistency property---loop freedom---we develop an update algorithm that has provably minimal dependency structure.
We sketch a general architecture for consistent network updates which separates the twin concerns of correctness and efficiency.
