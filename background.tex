Judging from the early papers on this topic, primary motivations for SDNs were to counter the ill-effects of distributed computation with partial knowledge and management complexity. distributed interactions between routers ...

The primary motivations 

For example, consider the Routing Control Platform (RCP)~\cite{rcp-case,rcp}, one of the first proposals that separated the control and data plane of routers. It used a centralized control plane that directly configured the routers in an autonomous system (AS). The primary motivations for this organization were "problems such as protocol oscillations and persistent loops"~\cite{rcp} that can occur in certain iBGP architectures.
