\section{Summary}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We argued that consistent updates is an important and rich area for future research into SDNs.  We highlighted the trade-off between the strength of the consistency property and the dependency structure it imposes, and developed minimal algorithms for loop freedom. We also sketched an architecture for consistent and quick updates in SDNs.
