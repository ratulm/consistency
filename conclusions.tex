\section{Summary}
\label{sec:conclusions}

By taking a broad view of consistent updates in SDNs, we highlighted the trade-off between the strength of the consistency property and the intricacy of the dependency structure it imposes.  For one particular consistency property---loop freedom---we developed an update algorithm that has a provably minimal dependency structure. We sketched a general architecture for implementing consistent network updates which separates the twin concerns of correctness and efficiency.
